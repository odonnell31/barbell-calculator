# barbell-calculator

Weightlifting is popular, and people like to compare (or show off) their strength/skill by citing the weight they can lift.
But sometimes, it's hard to think about how much weight a number corresponds to on a barbell.
For example, how many 45 lb plates are constitute a 500 lb lift?
More specifically, how many weights do I need to put on each side of a standard barbell for a 500 lb lift?

So, these python files solve that common question.
The barcbell-calculator calculates the weights needed for a barbell lift of any weight.
